Wraps common terms with a link to a definition of that term. Built-in dictionary provides defaults for many sexuality-related phrases.

== Description ==

WP Simple Sex-Positive Glossary automatically turns a number of sexuality-related terms into links that point to well-respected pages that provide definitions of those terms. It's an extremely simple and lightweight way to offer readers context so that you don't have to do the hard work of re-explaining yourself and your vocabulary all the time.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin file.
1. Unzip the file into your 'wp-content/plugins/' directory.
1. Activate the plugin from your WordPress Admin Plugins screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add my own terms? =
No, not yet. However, you can suggest additions to the built-in dictionary by leaving a comment on [the plugin page](http://maybemaimed.com/playground/wp-simple-sex-positive-glossary/).

= Can I style the glossary links specially? =

Yes. When the plugin turns a term into a link, it adds a `class` of `sspg term` to the `<a>` element. In your style sheet, use a CSS selector like `a.sspg.term { cursor: help; }` to give the glossary links a special rollover style (for instance). You are only limited by your skill and imagination. :)

Standing on the shoulders of giants is the only way to reach higher.
